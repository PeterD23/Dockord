# Dockord
Discord Bot for running Docker containers, written in .NET Core

#Outline
Docker is a neat technology for quickly spinning up virtual machines that interface directly with the hardware. Its use as a tool for running dedicated servers for games means with an interface on hand like a Discord Bot, these servers can be managed entirely through commands to the bot.

Dockord aims to achieve the following goals:
1. Being written in .NET Core (Need to add C# to my CV somehow!)
2. Being able to build, start, restart and terminate containers for games written with a common definition layer (i.e abstracting away the technical parameters needed for spinning up containers)
3. Runnable on Windows or Linux and exposes its functionality via a Discord Bot interface
