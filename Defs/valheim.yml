post-build-comment: The Valheim Server configured should now be running under the supplied name. If this is your first valheim server, allow some time (depending on your internet connection) for the server files to download. Once this is done, the server should start automatically. Ensure when connecting to the server you supply the PUBLIC port and not the private. Also make sure you remember the password set since I'm not gonna remind you
